 <p Id = "text">So guys today is a Friday morning. If someone told me that life will turn out this way I would never have belived you.
 In fact I will have imaged this to be a like a movie. whatever we are experincing, maby it is nothing compared to what is happening next. Next we life could turn out to be the movie the bird box. In case you dont know what happens in the bird box. There are creatures who come after humans if they make noise. These creatures are blind. But they can hear humans. Now you as the reader tell me what is worse this pendemic or the next pendemic where we may have to experience the bird box?  </p>
