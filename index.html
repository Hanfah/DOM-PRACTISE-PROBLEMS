 <p Id = "text">If someone told me that life will turn out this way I would never have belived you.
 In fact I will have imaged this to be a like a movie. whatever we are experiencing write now in life, maby it is nothing compared to what is may happen if we were to have another pendemic. The next pendemic life could turn out to be like the movie "the bird box". In case you dont know what happens in the bird box. There are creatures who come after humans if they make noise. These creatures are blind. But they can hear humans. Now you as the reader tell me what is worse this pendemic or the next pendemic where we may have to experience the bird box? I know which I prefer.  </p>
